Group by severity. Include concrete suggestions (what to change and where).\",\n  \"files_to_revise\": [\"path/to/file1.tsx\", \"path/to/file2.ts\", \"...\"]\n}\n\n## Feedback Guidelines (when rejecting)\n- Be direct and constructive.\n- Prefer specific, testable instructions over vague advice.\n- Reference acceptance criteria explicitly (e.g., “AC-2 not met: …”).\n- If you suggest UI changes, describe expected behavior precisely.\n- Mention any accessibility issues found.\n- Keep “files_to_revise” limited to files that must change.\n\n# Project Context\n\n## File Tree\npublic/\n  favicon.svg\n  manifest.json\n  robots.txt\nsrc/\n  components/\n    Button.tsx\n    Footer.tsx\n    FormInput.tsx\n    Header.tsx\n    PricingCard.tsx\n    PricingCard.tsx.diff\n  data/\n    mockData.ts\n  pages/\n    HomePage.tsx\n    PricingPage.tsx\n    PricingPage.tsx.diff\n  App.css\n  App.tsx\n  index.css\n  main.tsx\nREADME.md\nindex.css\nindex.html\npackage.json\ntailwind.config.ts\ntsconfig.app.json\ntsconfig.json\ntsconfig.node.json\ntsconfig.tsbuildinfo\nvite.config.ts\n\n## Project installed dependencies:\n@faker-js/faker, @heroicons/react, @hookform/resolvers, @tailwindcss/vite, chart.js, event-source-polyfill, leaflet, lucide-react, prismjs, qrcode.react, react, react-chartjs-2, react-datepicker, react-dom, react-draggable, react-helmet, react-hook-form, react-icons, react-leaflet, react-number-format, react-router-dom, react-toastify, react-transition-group, swiper, tailwind-merge, tailwindcss, uuid, zod\n@axe-core/playwright, @eslint/js, @playwright/test, @types/leaflet, @types/node, @types/prismjs, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/react-transition-group, @vitejs/plugin-react, eslint, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh, globals, typescript, typescript-eslint, vite\n\n# POKIO-Planner's overall plan overview:\nBuild a fully functional 3-page React application for PRIM-Agency with shared Header (including mobile menu) and Footer components, a Home landing page, a Pricing page with 3 plan cards and billing toggle, and a Contact page with validated form and success notification. All components will be accessible, keyboard-navigable, and responsive using Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\n- [x] Step 1: Create shared components and mock data\n- [x] Step 2: Create Home page\n- [x] Step 3: Create Pricing page with billing toggle\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 5: Integrate routing in App.tsx - Modify src/App.tsx to set up React Router with routes for /, /pricing, and /contact. Import BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom. Import HomePage, PricingPage, and ContactPage components. Wrap the entire app in BrowserRouter and define Routes with three Route elements pointing to the respective page components. Remove any default content from App.tsx. Ensure the app structure is clean with only routing configuration. The Header and Footer components are already included in each page component, so App.tsx should only handle routing.\n"

Component structure: ✓ Exports default component with Header, main, Footer\\n2. Form validation: ✓ react-hook-form + zod schema with correct rules (Name required, Email required + valid format, Message min 10 chars)\\n3. FormInput usage: ✓ Used for all three fields with proper error handling\\n4. Form aria-label: ✓ Present on form element\\n5. Accessibility - aria-invalid: ✗ MISSING - FormInput component needs to receive aria-invalid and aria-describedby props, but they're not being passed from ContactPage\\n6. Error messages: ✗ INCOMPLETE - FormInput receives error prop, but we need to verify it implements role=\\\"alert\\\" and aria-describedby connection (this is FormInput's responsibility, but ContactPage should pass necessary props)\\n7. Toast notification: ✓ Shows 'Message sent successfully!' on submit, form resets\\n8. ToastContainer: ✓ Configured and rendered\\n9. Tailwind styling: ✓ Centered layout with max-w-2xl, form has proper styling, Button uses primary variant\\n\\nCritical Issue: The FormInput component is being used, but we need to check if it properly implements aria-invalid and aria-describedby. Looking at the usage, ContactPage passes register and error, but doesn't explicitly pass aria-invalid or aria-describedby. The FormInput component should handle this internally based on the error prop, but without seeing FormInput's implementation in this review, I cannot confirm it does.\\n\\nHowever, AC-4 and AC-5 explicitly require: 'invalid fields have aria-invalid=\\\"true\\\"' and 'Error messages... connected via aria-describedby'. The current implementation relies entirely on FormInput to handle this, but ContactPage doesn't ensure these attributes are set.\\n\\nAdditional issues:\\n- Toast message says 'Message sent successfully!' but AC-6 specifies exact text 'Message sent successfully' (minor discrepancy with exclamation mark)\\n- The textarea needs minimum 10 characters validation which is in the schema ✓\\n\\nSince FormInput component was created in Step 1 and should handle accessibility internally, I need to verify if ContactPage is using it correctly. The acceptance criteria state that ContactPage must ensure these accessibility features are present. Without explicit props being passed or verification that FormInput handles this, this is a potential gap.\\n\\nGiven that AC-4 and AC-5 are explicit requirements for THIS step and the implementation doesn't show clear evidence of aria-invalid and aria-describedby being set (either through explicit props or documented FormInput behavior), this should be rejected for clarification and explicit implementation.\",\n  \"review_decision\": \"rejected\",\n  \"feedback\": \"The ContactPage implementation is mostly solid, but has critical accessibility gaps that must be addressed:\\n\\n**HIGH SEVERITY - Accessibility Requirements Not Met:**\\n\\n1. **AC-4 & AC-5: Missing aria-invalid and aria-describedby attributes**\\n   - The acceptance criteria explicitly require invalid fields to have `aria-invalid=\\\"true\\\"` and error messages connected via `aria-describedby`\\n   - Current implementation passes `register` and `error` to FormInput but doesn't explicitly ensure these ARIA attributes are set\\n   - **Required fix:** Verify that FormInput component properly implements these attributes based on the error prop. If not, you need to either:\\n     a) Update FormInput to add `aria-invalid={!!error}` and `aria-describedby={error ? `${name}-error` : undefined}` to the input element, OR\\n     b) Pass these props explicitly from ContactPage to FormInput\\n   - The error message element in FormInput must have `id=\\\"{name}-error\\\"` to match the aria-describedby reference\\n\\n2. **AC-5: Error messages must have role=\\\"alert\\\"**\\n   - Verify that FormInput renders error messages with `role=\\\"alert\\\"`\\n   - If FormInput doesn't implement this, it needs to be added\\n\\n**MEDIUM SEVERITY - Text Mismatch:**\\n\\n3. **AC-6: Toast message text discrepancy**\\n   - Current: \\\"Message sent successfully!\\\"\\n   - Required: \\\"Message sent successfully\\\" (no exclamation mark)\\n   - Change line 42 to: `toast.success('Message sent successfully', {`\\n\\n**Recommended Actions:**\\n\\n1.
