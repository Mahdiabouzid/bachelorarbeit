Group by severity. Include concrete suggestions (what to change and where).\",\n  \"files_to_revise\": [\"path/to/file1.tsx\", \"path/to/file2.ts\", \"...\"]\n}\n\n## Feedback Guidelines (when rejecting)\n- Be direct and constructive.\n- Prefer specific, testable instructions over vague advice.\n- Reference acceptance criteria explicitly (e.g., “AC-2 not met: …”).\n- If you suggest UI changes, describe expected behavior precisely.\n- Mention any accessibility issues found.\n- Keep “files_to_revise” limited to files that must change.\n\n# Project Context\n\n## File Tree\npublic/\n  favicon.svg\n  manifest.json\n  robots.txt\nsrc/\n  components/\n    Button.tsx\n    Footer.tsx\n    FormInput.tsx\n    Header.tsx\n    PricingCard.tsx\n  data/\n    mockData.ts\n  pages/\n    HomePage.tsx\n  App.css\n  App.tsx\n  index.css\n  main.tsx\nREADME.md\nindex.css\nindex.html\npackage.json\ntailwind.config.ts\ntsconfig.app.json\ntsconfig.json\ntsconfig.node.json\ntsconfig.tsbuildinfo\nvite.config.ts\n\n## Project installed dependencies:\n@faker-js/faker, @heroicons/react, @hookform/resolvers, @tailwindcss/vite, chart.js, event-source-polyfill, leaflet, lucide-react, prismjs, qrcode.react, react, react-chartjs-2, react-datepicker, react-dom, react-draggable, react-helmet, react-hook-form, react-icons, react-leaflet, react-number-format, react-router-dom, react-toastify, react-transition-group, swiper, tailwind-merge, tailwindcss, uuid, zod\n@axe-core/playwright, @eslint/js, @playwright/test, @types/leaflet, @types/node, @types/prismjs, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/react-transition-group, @vitejs/plugin-react, eslint, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh, globals, typescript, typescript-eslint, vite\n\n# POKIO-Planner's overall plan overview:\nBuild a fully functional 3-page React application for PRIM-Agency with shared Header (including mobile menu) and Footer components, a Home landing page, a Pricing page with 3 plan cards and billing toggle, and a Contact page with validated form and success notification. All components will be accessible, keyboard-navigable, and responsive using Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\n- [x] Step 1: Create shared components and mock data\n- [x] Step 2: Create Home page\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 4: Create Contact page with validated form - Create src/pages/ContactPage.tsx that imports Header, Footer, FormInput, and Button components. The page must have a <main> element containing a heading \"Contact Us\" and a form with fields: Name (text input), Email (email input), Message (textarea). Use react-hook-form for form management and zod for validation schema. Validation rules: Name required, Email required + valid email format, Message required with minimum 10 characters. Create a Zod schema with these rules. Use FormInput component for each field, passing register function and error messages. The form must have onSubmit handler that calls handleSubmit from react-hook-form. On successful validation, show a toast notification using react-toastify with text \"Message sent successfully\" and reset the form. Import and configure ToastContainer from react-toastify at the top of the component. Style with Tailwind: centered form with max-width, inputs with border and focus states, submit button with primary color. Ensure accessibility: form has aria-label=\"Contact form\", invalid fields have aria-invalid=\"true\" and aria-describedby pointing to error message IDs, error messages have role=\"alert\".\n- [ ] Step 5: Integrate routing in App.tsx - Modify src/App.tsx to set up React Router with routes for /, /pricing, and /contact. Import BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom. Import HomePage, PricingPage, and ContactPage components. Wrap the entire app in BrowserRouter and define Routes with three Route elements pointing to the respective page components. Remove any default content from App.tsx. Ensure the app structure is clean with only routing configuration. The Header and Footer components are already included in each page component, so App.tsx should only handle routing.\n"

The page must have a <main> element containing: a heading \"Pricing Plans\", a billing period toggle (Monthly/Yearly), and 3 pricing cards. The toggle must be implemented as a button group with two buttons (Monthly, Yearly) where the active button is visually distinct. The toggle container must have role=\"group\" and aria-label=\"Billing period toggle\". Each button must have aria-pressed attribute indicating its state. Use React useState to track the selected period (\"monthly\" or \"yearly\"). Map over the pricingPlans data from mockData.ts to render 3 PricingCard components. Pass isRecommended=true only to the Pro plan. Each card's CTA button must have aria-label like \"Get Started with Basic\". Style with Tailwind: centered layout, toggle buttons with border and background color changes for active state, cards in a responsive grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3), Pro card with a \"Recommended\" badge positioned absolutely at the top. Ensure keyboard navigation: toggle buttons must be focusable and operable with Enter/Space keys.\n\n# Step acceptance criteria:\n['PricingPage.tsx exports a default component that renders Header, main content with pricing section, and Footer', 'Billing toggle implemented as button group with role=\"group\" and aria-label=\"Billing period toggle\"', 'Toggle buttons have aria-pressed attributes and are keyboard operable (Enter/Space)', 'useState tracks selected period (\"monthly\" or \"yearly\") and updates displayed prices', '3 PricingCard components rendered from mockData.ts with correct prices based on selected period', 'Pro plan card has isRecommended=true and displays \"Recommended\" badge', 'Each CTA button has aria-label like \"Get Started with [Plan Name]\"', 'Cards displayed in responsive grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3) with Tailwind styling']\n\n# Step expected files, as defined by POKIO-Planner:\n['src/pages/PricingPage.tsx']\n\n# POKIO-Coder's implemented files for the current step:\n\nFILE: src/pages/PricingPage.tsx\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport Header from '../components/Header';\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer';\nimport PricingCard from '../components/PricingCard';\nimport { pricingPlans } from '../data/mockData';\n\nconst PricingPage: React.FC = () => {\n  const [billingPeriod, setBillingPeriod] = useState<'monthly' | 'yearly'>('monthly');\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"min-h-screen flex flex-col\">\n      <Header />\n\n      <main className=\"flex-grow bg-gray-50 py-16 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n        <div className=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto\">\n          <div className=\"text-center mb-12\">\n            <h1 className=\"text-4xl font-extrabold text-gray-900 sm:text-5xl\">\n              Pricing Plans\n            </h1>\n            <p className=\"mt-4 text-xl text-gray-600\">\n              Choose the perfect plan for your business needs.\n            </p>\n\n            {/* Billing Toggle */}\n            <div className=\"mt-8 flex justify-center\">\n              <div \n                className=\"relative flex bg-gray-200 rounded-lg p-1\"\n                role=\"group\" \n                aria-label=\"Billing period toggle\"\n              >\n                <button\n                  type=\"button\"\n                  onClick={() => setBillingPeriod('monthly')}\n                  aria-pressed={billingPeriod === 'monthly'}\n                  className={`relative w-28 py-2 text-sm font-medium rounded-md transition-all focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 ${\n                    billingPeriod === 'monthly'\n                      ?
