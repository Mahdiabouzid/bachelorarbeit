With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write the code necessary to complete the given step. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response. Only 1 tool can be used per message.\n\n## fetch_files\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\":\"<step by step reasoning>\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/file1.tsx\", \"path/to/file2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files\n\nWrite, modify, or delete files. Only **one call per step**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\":\"<step by step reasoning>\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"One or two sentence description of what was implemented\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Explanation of what was changed, component behavior, and architectural choices\",\n    \"changes\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/Button.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content for new files\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block>\\n=======\\n<new code block>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### write_to_files tool rules:\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n  *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. Folders are created automatically when files are created.\n  *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n  *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\nIf you don't need to output any changes (for exmaple a verification step) simply return an empty `changes` array.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE RULES:\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Must be in the following format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Blocks Must be as minimal as possible, you MUST produce targeted changes. For example if you want to change only 1 line then target only that exact line and not the whole block. Remmeber to generate SEARCH/REPLACE in the correct format.\n\n## Critical rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\n# EXAMPLES\n## Example `fetch_files` tool usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze Step:** The goal is to add a protected '/profile' route.

Modifying `src/App.tsx` directly might break the existing separation of concerns.\\n4. **Action:** I need to inspect `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx` to add the new route there.

  "content": "## Overall plan overview:\nBuild a fully functional 3-page React application for PRIM-Agency with shared Header (including mobile menu) and Footer components, a Home landing page, a Pricing page with 3 plan cards and billing toggle, and a Contact page with validated form and success notification. All components will be accessible, keyboard-navigable, and responsive using Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\nThese steps have already been completed by you. Assume the code for these exists.\n- [x] Step 1: Create shared components and mock data\n- [x] Step 2: Create Home page\n- [x] Step 3: Create Pricing page with billing toggle\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 5: Integrate routing in App.tsx - Modify src/App.tsx to set up React Router with routes for /, /pricing, and /contact. Import BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom. Import HomePage, PricingPage, and ContactPage components. Wrap the entire app in BrowserRouter and define Routes with three Route elements pointing to the respective page components. Remove any default content from App.tsx. Ensure the app structure is clean with only routing configuration. The Header and Footer components are already included in each page component, so App.tsx should only handle routing.\n\n\n        ## Step 4/5: Create Contact page with validated form\n\n        **Description:**  \n        Create src/pages/ContactPage.tsx that imports Header, Footer, FormInput, and Button components. The page must have a <main> element containing a heading \"Contact Us\" and a form with fields: Name (text input), Email (email input), Message (textarea). Use react-hook-form for form management and zod for validation schema. Validation rules: Name required, Email required + valid email format, Message required with minimum 10 characters. Create a Zod schema with these rules. Use FormInput component for each field, passing register function and error messages. The form must have onSubmit handler that calls handleSubmit from react-hook-form. On successful validation, show a toast notification using react-toastify with text \"Message sent successfully\" and reset the form. Import and configure ToastContainer from react-toastify at the top of the component. Style with Tailwind: centered form with max-width, inputs with border and focus states, submit button with primary color.

Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n  *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\nIf you don't need to output any changes (for exmaple a verification step) simply return an empty `changes` array.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE RULES:\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Must be in the following format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Blocks Must be as minimal as possible, you MUST produce targeted changes. For example if you want to change only 1 line then target only that exact line and not the whole block. Remmeber to generate SEARCH/REPLACE in the correct format.\n\n## Critical rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\n# EXAMPLES\n## Example `fetch_files` tool usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze Step:** The goal is to add a protected '/profile' route.

I also need to check `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (found in metadata) to understand how to check for authentication (e.g., `useAuth` hook) for the protection logic.\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\n      \"src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx\",\n      \"src/context/AuthContext.tsx\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n## Example `write_to_files` tool usage:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze New Component (PricingPage):** \\n   *   I need to create `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx`. \\n   *   **Reuse Strategy:** In the provided context, I see `src/components/ui/Button.tsx` exports a `Button` component with `ButtonProps` accepting `variant` ('primary' | 'outline'). I also see `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` exporting composable parts (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardBody`). I will use these exactly as defined to ensure visual consistency.\\n   *   **Styling:** I will verify `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` styles. It uses `text-4xl font-extrabold text-gray-900` for main headings. I will apply the same typography to the Pricing title for a cohesive look.\\n   *   **Accessibility:** I will use `<h2>` for the page title and `<h3>` for the plan names. The buttons will have descriptive text.\\n\\n2. **Integrate with Previous Work (LandingPage):**\\n   *   I see that `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` (from Step 2) has a CTA: `<Button>Get Started</Button>`. It lacks navigation.\\n   *   **Fix:** I will import `Link` from `react-router-dom` and wrap that button: `<Link to=\\\"/pricing\\\"><Button>Get Started</Button></Link>`.\\n\\n3. **Routing (App.tsx):**\\n   *   I need to import the new `PricingPage` and add `<Route path=\\\"/pricing\\\" element={<PricingPage />} />` to the existing router switch in `src/App.tsx`.\\n\\n4. **Execution Order:** Create the new page first, then wire up the route, then fix the broken link in the landing page.

  "content": "## Overall plan overview:\nBuild a fully functional 3-page React application for PRIM-Agency with shared Header (including mobile menu) and Footer components, a Home landing page, a Pricing page with 3 plan cards and billing toggle, and a Contact page with validated form and success notification. All components will be accessible, keyboard-navigable, and responsive using Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\nThese steps have already been completed by you. Assume the code for these exists.\n- [x] Step 1: Create shared components and mock data\n- [x] Step 2: Create Home page\n- [x] Step 3: Create Pricing page with billing toggle\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 5: Integrate routing in App.tsx - Modify src/App.tsx to set up React Router with routes for /, /pricing, and /contact. Import BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom. Import HomePage, PricingPage, and ContactPage components. Wrap the entire app in BrowserRouter and define Routes with three Route elements pointing to the respective page components. Remove any default content from App.tsx. Ensure the app structure is clean with only routing configuration. The Header and Footer components are already included in each page component, so App.tsx should only handle routing.\n\n\n        ## Step 4/5: Create Contact page with validated form\n\n        **Description:**  \n        Create src/pages/ContactPage.tsx that imports Header, Footer, FormInput, and Button components. The page must have a <main> element containing a heading \"Contact Us\" and a form with fields: Name (text input), Email (email input), Message (textarea). Use react-hook-form for form management and zod for validation schema. Validation rules: Name required, Email required + valid email format, Message required with minimum 10 characters. Create a Zod schema with these rules. Use FormInput component for each field, passing register function and error messages. The form must have onSubmit handler that calls handleSubmit from react-hook-form. On successful validation, show a toast notification using react-toastify with text \"Message sent successfully\" and reset the form. Import and configure ToastContainer from react-toastify at the top of the component. Style with Tailwind: centered form with max-width, inputs with border and focus states, submit button with primary color. Ensure accessibility: form has aria-label=\"Contact form\", invalid fields have aria-invalid=\"true\" and aria-describedby pointing to error message IDs, error messages have role=\"alert\".\n\n        **Files that must be produced in this step:**  \n        {'- `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`\\n'}\n\n        **Acceptance Criteria:**  \n        ['ContactPage.tsx exports a default component that renders Header, main content with contact form, and Footer', 'Form implemented with react-hook-form and zod validation schema (Name required, Email required + valid format, Message required min 10 chars)', 'FormInput components used for Name, Email, and Message fields with proper error handling', 'Form has aria-label=\"Contact form\" and invalid fields have aria-invalid=\"true\"', 'Error messages displayed inline next to fields with role=\"alert\" and connected via aria-describedby', 'On successful submit, toast notification shows \"Message sent successfully\" using react-toastify', 'ToastContainer configured and rendered in the component', 'Form styled with Tailwind: centered layout, max-width, input borders, focus states, primary button color']\n\n        ## Task:\n        Fully implement the step in one single `write_to_files` tool call.\n        \n\n### Pre-fetched content of relevant files:\nIMPORTANT: If you need the contents of a file that is not listed in these files, you MUST first fetch its content using the fetch_files tool.\nFILE: src/components/Header.tsx\n```tsx\nimport React, { useState } from 'react';\nimport { Link, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';\nimport { Bars3Icon, XMarkIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/solid';\n\nconst Header: React.FC = () => {\n  const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const navLinks = [\n    { name: 'Home', path: '/' },\n    { name: 'Pricing', path: '/pricing' },\n    { name: 'Contact', path: '/contact' },\n  ];\n\n  return (\n    <header className=\"sticky top-0 z-50 bg-white border-b border-gray-200\">\n      <nav className=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\" aria-label=\"Top\">\n        <div className=\"flex justify-between items-center h-16\">\n          {/* Logo */}\n          <div className=\"flex-shrink-0\">\n            <Link to=\"/\" className=\"text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600\" aria-label=\"PRIM-Agency\">\n              PRIM-Agency\n            </Link>\n          </div>\n\n          {/* Desktop Nav */}\n          <div className=\"hidden md:flex space-x-8\">\n            {navLinks.map((link) => (\n              <NavLink\n                key={link.name}\n                to={link.path}\n                className={({ isActive }) =>\n                  `text-sm font-medium transition-colors hover:text-blue-600 ${isActive ?

  "content": "\nYour previous implementation was subject to review and was rejected. Feedback:\nThe ContactPage implementation is mostly solid, but has critical accessibility gaps that must be addressed:\n\n**HIGH SEVERITY - Accessibility Requirements Not Met:**\n\n1. **AC-4 & AC-5: Missing aria-invalid and aria-describedby attributes**\n   - The acceptance criteria explicitly require invalid fields to have `aria-invalid=\"true\"` and error messages connected via `aria-describedby`\n   - Current implementation passes `register` and `error` to FormInput but doesn't explicitly ensure these ARIA attributes are set\n   - **Required fix:** Verify that FormInput component properly implements these attributes based on the error prop. If not, you need to either:\n     a) Update FormInput to add `aria-invalid={!!error}` and `aria-describedby={error ? `${name}-error` : undefined}` to the input element, OR\n     b) Pass these props explicitly from ContactPage to FormInput\n   - The error message element in FormInput must have `id=\"{name}-error\"` to match the aria-describedby reference\n\n2. **AC-5: Error messages must have role=\"alert\"**\n   - Verify that FormInput renders error messages with `role=\"alert\"`\n   - If FormInput doesn't implement this, it needs to be added\n\n**MEDIUM SEVERITY - Text Mismatch:**\n\n3. **AC-6: Toast message text discrepancy**\n   - Current: \"Message sent successfully!\"\n   - Required: \"Message sent successfully\" (no exclamation mark)\n   - Change line 42 to: `toast.success('Message sent successfully', {`\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n1. Review the FormInput component implementation from Step 1\n2. Ensure it renders the input with: `aria-invalid={!!error}` and `aria-describedby={error ? `${name}-error` : undefined}`\n3. Ensure error message div has: `id=\"{name}-error\"` and `role=\"alert\"`\n4. If FormInput doesn't handle this, update it accordingly\n5. Fix the toast message text to match AC-6 exactly\n\nThe form structure, validation schema, and overall implementation are correct.

I will adjust the `errorId` in `FormInput.tsx` to be more direct and ensure it perfectly matches the `aria-describedby` reference. \\n3. **Verify ContactPage usage**: The `ContactPage.tsx` already passes the `error` prop correctly, which triggers the logic inside `FormInput.tsx`.\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Fix Contact Page Accessibility and Toast Text\",\n    \"summary\": \"Updated the success toast message and refined the FormInput accessibility attributes to ensure full compliance with requirements.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"1.
