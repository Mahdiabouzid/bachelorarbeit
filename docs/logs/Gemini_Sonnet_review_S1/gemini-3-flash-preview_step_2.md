With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write the code necessary to complete the given step. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.

You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. Folders are created automatically when files are created.\n  *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n  *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\nIf you don't need to output any changes (for exmaple a verification step) simply return an empty `changes` array.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE RULES:\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Must be in the following format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Blocks Must be as minimal as possible, you MUST produce targeted changes. For example if you want to change only 1 line then target only that exact line and not the whole block. Remmeber to generate SEARCH/REPLACE in the correct format.\n\n## Critical rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\n# EXAMPLES\n## Example `fetch_files` tool usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze Step:** The goal is to add a protected '/profile' route.

  "content": "## Overall plan overview:\nBuild a fully functional 3-page React application for PRIM-Agency with shared Header (including mobile menu) and Footer components, a Home landing page, a Pricing page with 3 plan cards and billing toggle, and a Contact page with validated form and success notification. All components will be accessible, keyboard-navigable, and responsive using Tailwind CSS.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\nThese steps have already been completed by you. Assume the code for these exists.\n- [x] Step 1: Create shared components and mock data\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 3: Create Pricing page with billing toggle - Create src/pages/PricingPage.tsx that imports Header, Footer, PricingCard, and Button components. The page must have a <main> element containing: a heading \"Pricing Plans\", a billing period toggle (Monthly/Yearly), and 3 pricing cards. The toggle must be implemented as a button group with two buttons (Monthly, Yearly) where the active button is visually distinct. The toggle container must have role=\"group\" and aria-label=\"Billing period toggle\". Each button must have aria-pressed attribute indicating its state. Use React useState to track the selected period (\"monthly\" or \"yearly\"). Map over the pricingPlans data from mockData.ts to render 3 PricingCard components. Pass isRecommended=true only to the Pro plan. Each card's CTA button must have aria-label like \"Get Started with Basic\". Style with Tailwind: centered layout, toggle buttons with border and background color changes for active state, cards in a responsive grid (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3), Pro card with a \"Recommended\" badge positioned absolutely at the top. Ensure keyboard navigation: toggle buttons must be focusable and operable with Enter/Space keys.\n- [ ] Step 4: Create Contact page with validated form - Create src/pages/ContactPage.tsx that imports Header, Footer, FormInput, and Button components. The page must have a <main> element containing a heading \"Contact Us\" and a form with fields: Name (text input), Email (email input), Message (textarea). Use react-hook-form for form management and zod for validation schema. Validation rules: Name required, Email required + valid email format, Message required with minimum 10 characters. Create a Zod schema with these rules. Use FormInput component for each field, passing register function and error messages. The form must have onSubmit handler that calls handleSubmit from react-hook-form. On successful validation, show a toast notification using react-toastify with text \"Message sent successfully\" and reset the form. Import and configure ToastContainer from react-toastify at the top of the component. Style with Tailwind: centered form with max-width, inputs with border and focus states, submit button with primary color. Ensure accessibility: form has aria-label=\"Contact form\", invalid fields have aria-invalid=\"true\" and aria-describedby pointing to error message IDs, error messages have role=\"alert\".\n- [ ] Step 5: Integrate routing in App.tsx - Modify src/App.tsx to set up React Router with routes for /, /pricing, and /contact. Import BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route from react-router-dom. Import HomePage, PricingPage, and ContactPage components. Wrap the entire app in BrowserRouter and define Routes with three Route elements pointing to the respective page components. Remove any default content from App.tsx. Ensure the app structure is clean with only routing configuration. The Header and Footer components are already included in each page component, so App.tsx should only handle routing.\n\n\n        ## Step 2/5: Create Home page\n\n        **Description:**  \n        Create src/pages/HomePage.tsx that imports and uses Header and Footer components. The page must have a <main> element containing a hero section with: a large heading \"Welcome to PRIM-Agency\", a subheading describing the agency, and a CTA button linking to /pricing with text \"View Pricing\". Add a features section with 3 feature cards (use @faker-js/faker to generate feature titles and descriptions). Style with Tailwind: hero section with gradient background, centered text, large typography; features section with grid layout (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3), cards with padding, shadow, and hover effects. Ensure semantic HTML: use <h1> for main heading, <h2> for section headings, <section> for features.
