With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write the code necessary to complete the given step. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.

You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. Folders are created automatically when files are created.\n  *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n  *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\nIf you don't need to output any changes (for exmaple a verification step) simply return an empty `changes` array.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE RULES:\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Must be in the following format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Blocks Must be as minimal as possible, you MUST produce targeted changes. For example if you want to change only 1 line then target only that exact line and not the whole block. Remmeber to generate SEARCH/REPLACE in the correct format.\n\n## Critical rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\n# EXAMPLES\n## Example `fetch_files` tool usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze Step:** The goal is to add a protected '/profile' route.

  "content": "## Overall plan overview:\nThis plan builds a fully functional, accessible, and localized photo service promo app. It features a robust state management system for themes, accents, and languages, a simulated offline mode, and a responsive gallery with filtering. All configurations are persisted via localStorage.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\nThese steps have already been completed by you. Assume the code for these exists.\n- [x] Step 1: Foundations: Types, i18n, and Mock Data\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 3: Shared Components: Layout, Header, and DevToolbar - Create a `Layout` component that wraps all pages. It includes a `Header` with the 'Lumen' title and navigation links (Home, Gallery, Upload, About, Settings). Create a `DevToolbar` that stays visible, containing the 'Offline mode' toggle (`data-testid='offline-toggle'`) and the 'Offline mode enabled' indicator. Ensure the navigation uses semantic `<nav>` and `<a>` (via React Router `NavLink`).\n- [ ] Step 4: Pages: Home, About, and Upload - Implement the Home, About, and Upload pages. The Upload page must feature a mock form with a file picker, a disabled 'Upload' button, and helper text. All text must be retrieved from the translation context. Use Tailwind for responsive layouts.\n- [ ] Step 5: Page: Gallery with Filtering and Localization - Create the Gallery page. Implement a filter control with accessible name 'Filter' (All, Portrait, Nature, Urban). Render the 12 items in a responsive grid (`data-testid='gallery-grid'`). Each tile (`data-testid='gallery-item'`) must show the title, tags, and a localized date using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` based on the current language. If 'Offline mode' is enabled, the gallery should simulate loading from the `offlineCache`.\n- [ ] Step 6: Page: Settings - Create the Settings page with controls for Theme (toggle), Accent (select), Language (select), and Offline Mode (toggle). Ensure all controls have the required `data-testid` attributes (`theme-toggle`, `accent-select`, `language-select`) and accessible names. The accent selector must show labels: 'Ocean', 'Sunset', 'Forest'.\n- [ ] Step 7: Integration: Routing and Global Styles - Configure React Router in `src/App.tsx`. Wrap the application with the `AppContextProvider`. Define the routes for all pages. Update `src/index.css` to include the accent palette color definitions (e.g., `--accent-primary`) that change based on the `data-accent` attribute on the body.\n\n\n        ## Step 2/7: Global State: Context Providers\n\n        **Description:**  \n        Create a unified `AppContext` (or separate contexts) to manage: Theme (light/dark), Accent (ocean/sunset/forest), Language (en/de), and Offline Mode (boolean). Implement localStorage persistence for all settings using the specified keys (`lumen.theme`, `lumen.accent`, `lumen.lang`). The accent palettes should be implemented as CSS variables or Tailwind classes applied to a root element.\n\n        **Files that must be produced in this step:**  \n        {'- `src/context/AppContext.tsx`\\n'}\n\n        **Acceptance Criteria:**  \n        ['Context provides state and setters for theme, accent, language, and offline mode.', 'Values persist in localStorage on change.', 'Language state affects the document lang attribute.', 'Theme and Accent state apply corresponding classes to the document body or a wrapper.']\n\n        ## Task:\n        Fully implement the step in one single `write_to_files` tool call.\n        \n\n### Pre-fetched content of relevant files:\nIMPORTANT: If you need the contents of a file that is not listed in these files, you MUST first fetch its content using the fetch_files tool.\nFILE: src/types/index.ts\n```tsx\nexport type Theme = 'light' | 'dark';\nexport type Accent = 'ocean' | 'sunset' | 'forest';\nexport type Language = 'en' | 'de';\nexport type Category = 'Portrait' | 'Nature' | 'Urban';\n\nexport interface GalleryItem {\n  id: string;\n  titleKey: string;\n  date: string;\n  category: Category;\n  imageUrl: string;\n  tags: string[];\n}\n\nexport interface AppState {\n  theme: Theme;\n  accent: Accent;\n  language: Language;\n  isOffline: boolean;\n}\n```"
