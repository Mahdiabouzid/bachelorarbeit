You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. Folders are created automatically when files are created.\n  *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n  *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\nIf you don't need to output any changes (for exmaple a verification step) simply return an empty `changes` array.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE RULES:\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Must be in the following format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Blocks Must be as minimal as possible, you MUST produce targeted changes. For example if you want to change only 1 line then target only that exact line and not the whole block. Remmeber to generate SEARCH/REPLACE in the correct format.\n\n## Critical rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\n# EXAMPLES\n## Example `fetch_files` tool usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze Step:** The goal is to add a protected '/profile' route.

  "content": "## Overall plan overview:\nThis plan builds a fully functional, accessible, and localized photo service promo app. It features a robust state management system for themes, accents, and languages, a simulated offline mode, and a responsive gallery with filtering. All configurations are persisted via localStorage.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\nThese steps have already been completed by you. Assume the code for these exists.\n- [x] Step 1: Foundations: Types, i18n, and Mock Data\n- [x] Step 2: Global State: Context Providers\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 4: Pages: Home, About, and Upload - Implement the Home, About, and Upload pages. The Upload page must feature a mock form with a file picker, a disabled 'Upload' button, and helper text. All text must be retrieved from the translation context. Use Tailwind for responsive layouts.\n- [ ] Step 5: Page: Gallery with Filtering and Localization - Create the Gallery page. Implement a filter control with accessible name 'Filter' (All, Portrait, Nature, Urban). Render the 12 items in a responsive grid (`data-testid='gallery-grid'`). Each tile (`data-testid='gallery-item'`) must show the title, tags, and a localized date using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` based on the current language. If 'Offline mode' is enabled, the gallery should simulate loading from the `offlineCache`.\n- [ ] Step 6: Page: Settings - Create the Settings page with controls for Theme (toggle), Accent (select), Language (select), and Offline Mode (toggle). Ensure all controls have the required `data-testid` attributes (`theme-toggle`, `accent-select`, `language-select`) and accessible names. The accent selector must show labels: 'Ocean', 'Sunset', 'Forest'.\n- [ ] Step 7: Integration: Routing and Global Styles - Configure React Router in `src/App.tsx`. Wrap the application with the `AppContextProvider`. Define the routes for all pages. Update `src/index.css` to include the accent palette color definitions (e.g., `--accent-primary`) that change based on the `data-accent` attribute on the body.\n\n\n        ## Step 3/7: Shared Components: Layout, Header, and DevToolbar\n\n        **Description:**  \n        Create a `Layout` component that wraps all pages. It includes a `Header` with the 'Lumen' title and navigation links (Home, Gallery, Upload, About, Settings). Create a `DevToolbar` that stays visible, containing the 'Offline mode' toggle (`data-testid='offline-toggle'`) and the 'Offline mode enabled' indicator. Ensure the navigation uses semantic `<nav>` and `<a>` (via React Router `NavLink`).\n\n        **Files that must be produced in this step:**  \n        {'- `src/components/Layout.tsx`\\n- `src/components/Header.tsx`\\n- `src/components/DevToolbar.tsx`\\n'}\n\n        **Acceptance Criteria:**  \n        ['Header contains links labeled exactly: Home, Gallery, Upload, About, Settings.', \"DevToolbar shows 'Offline mode enabled' only when the state is active.\", 'Layout uses semantic HTML (<header>, <main>, <footer>).', 'Navigation links use active styling to indicate the current route.']\n\n        ## Task:\n        Fully implement the step in one single `write_to_files` tool call.\n        \n\n### Pre-fetched content of relevant files:\nIMPORTANT: If you need the contents of a file that is not listed in these files, you MUST first fetch its content using the fetch_files tool.\nFILE: src/context/AppContext.tsx\n```tsx\nimport React, { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect, ReactNode } from 'react';\nimport { Theme, Accent, Language } from '../types';\n\ninterface AppContextType {\n  theme: Theme;\n  accent: Accent;\n  language: Language;\n  isOffline: boolean;\n  setTheme: (theme: Theme) => void;\n  setAccent: (accent: Accent) => void;\n  setLanguage: (lang: Language) => void;\n  setIsOffline: (isOffline: boolean) => void;\n}\n\nconst AppContext = createContext<AppContextType | undefined>(undefined);\n\nconst STORAGE_KEYS = {\n  THEME: 'lumen.theme',\n  ACCENT: 'lumen.accent',\n  LANG: 'lumen.lang',\n};\n\nexport const AppContextProvider: React.FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {\n  // Initialize state from localStorage or defaults\n  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>(() => \n    (localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEYS.THEME) as Theme) || 'light'\n  );\n  const [accent, setAccent] = useState<Accent>(() => \n    (localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEYS.ACCENT) as Accent) || 'ocean'\n  );\n  const [language, setLanguage] = useState<Language>(() => \n    (localStorage.getItem(STORAGE_KEYS.LANG) as Language) || 'en'\n  );\n  const [isOffline, setIsOffline] = useState<boolean>(false);\n\n  // Persist and apply Theme\n  useEffect(() => {\n    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.THEME, theme);\n    document.body.classList.remove('light', 'dark');\n    document.body.classList.add(theme);\n  }, [theme]);\n\n  // Persist and apply Accent\n  useEffect(() => {\n    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.ACCENT, accent);\n    document.body.dataset.accent = accent;\n  }, [accent]);\n\n  // Persist and apply Language\n  useEffect(() => {\n    localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEYS.LANG, language);\n    document.documentElement.lang = language;\n  }, [language]);\n\n  const value = {\n    theme,\n    accent,\n    language,\n    isOffline,\n    setTheme,\n    setAccent,\n    setLanguage,\n    setIsOffline,\n  };\n\n  return <AppContext.Provider value={value}>{children}</AppContext.Provider>;\n};\n\nexport const useAppContext = () => {\n  const context = useContext(AppContext);\n  if (context === undefined) {\n    throw new Error('useAppContext must be used within an AppContextProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n};\n\nexport default AppContext;\n```\n\nFILE: src/i18n/en.ts\n```tsx\nexport const en = {\n  nav: {\n    home: 'Home',\n    gallery: 'Gallery',\n    upload: 'Upload',\n    about: 'About',\n    settings: 'Settings',\n  },\n  home: {\n    title: 'Welcome to Lumen',\n    subtitle: 'Capturing light, preserving moments.',\n    cta: 'Explore Gallery',\n  },\n  gallery: {\n    title: 'Photo Gallery',\n    filter: 'Filter',\n    categories: {\n      all: 'All',\n      portrait: 'Portrait',\n      nature: 'Nature',\n      urban: 'Urban',\n    },\n    empty: 'No photos found.',\n  },\n  upload: {\n    title: 'Upload Photo',\n    dropzone: 'Click or drag photo to this area to upload',\n    submit: 'Upload',\n    helper: 'Supported formats: JPG, PNG.
