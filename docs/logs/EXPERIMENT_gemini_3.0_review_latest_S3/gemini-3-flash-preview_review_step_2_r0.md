Group by severity. Include concrete suggestions (what to change and where).\",\n  \"files_to_revise\": [\"path/to/file1.tsx\", \"path/to/file2.ts\", \"...\"]\n}\n\n## Feedback Guidelines (when rejecting)\n- Be direct and constructive.\n- Prefer specific, testable instructions over vague advice.\n- Reference acceptance criteria explicitly (e.g., “AC-2 not met: …”).\n- If you suggest UI changes, describe expected behavior precisely.\n- Mention any accessibility issues found.\n- Keep “files_to_revise” limited to files that must change.\n\n# Project Context\n\n## File Tree\npublic/\n  favicon.svg\n  manifest.json\n  robots.txt\nsrc/\n  data/\n    gallery.ts\n  i18n/\n    de.ts\n    en.ts\n  types/\n    index.ts\n  utils/\n    offlineCache.ts\n  App.css\n  App.tsx\n  index.css\n  main.tsx\nREADME.md\nindex.html\npackage.json\ntailwind.config.ts\ntailwind.config.ts.diff\ntsconfig.app.json\ntsconfig.json\ntsconfig.node.json\ntsconfig.tsbuildinfo\nvite.config.ts\n\n## Project installed dependencies:\n@faker-js/faker, @heroicons/react, @hookform/resolvers, @tailwindcss/vite, chart.js, event-source-polyfill, leaflet, lucide-react, prismjs, qrcode.react, react, react-chartjs-2, react-datepicker, react-dom, react-draggable, react-helmet, react-hook-form, react-icons, react-leaflet, react-number-format, react-router-dom, react-toastify, react-transition-group, swiper, tailwind-merge, tailwindcss, uuid, zod\n@axe-core/playwright, @eslint/js, @playwright/test, @types/leaflet, @types/node, @types/prismjs, @types/react, @types/react-dom, @types/react-transition-group, @vitejs/plugin-react, eslint, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, eslint-plugin-react-refresh, globals, typescript, typescript-eslint, vite\n\n# POKIO-Planner's overall plan overview:\nThis plan builds a fully functional, accessible, and localized photo service promo app. It features a robust state management system for themes, accents, and languages, a simulated offline mode, and a responsive gallery with filtering. All configurations are persisted via localStorage.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\n- [x] Step 1: Foundations: Types, i18n, and Mock Data\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 3: Shared Components: Layout, Header, and DevToolbar - Create a `Layout` component that wraps all pages. It includes a `Header` with the 'Lumen' title and navigation links (Home, Gallery, Upload, About, Settings). Create a `DevToolbar` that stays visible, containing the 'Offline mode' toggle (`data-testid='offline-toggle'`) and the 'Offline mode enabled' indicator. Ensure the navigation uses semantic `<nav>` and `<a>` (via React Router `NavLink`).\n- [ ] Step 4: Pages: Home, About, and Upload - Implement the Home, About, and Upload pages. The Upload page must feature a mock form with a file picker, a disabled 'Upload' button, and helper text. All text must be retrieved from the translation context. Use Tailwind for responsive layouts.\n- [ ] Step 5: Page: Gallery with Filtering and Localization - Create the Gallery page. Implement a filter control with accessible name 'Filter' (All, Portrait, Nature, Urban). Render the 12 items in a responsive grid (`data-testid='gallery-grid'`). Each tile (`data-testid='gallery-item'`) must show the title, tags, and a localized date using `Intl.DateTimeFormat` based on the current language. If 'Offline mode' is enabled, the gallery should simulate loading from the `offlineCache`.\n- [ ] Step 6: Page: Settings - Create the Settings page with controls for Theme (toggle), Accent (select), Language (select), and Offline Mode (toggle). Ensure all controls have the required `data-testid` attributes (`theme-toggle`, `accent-select`, `language-select`) and accessible names. The accent selector must show labels: 'Ocean', 'Sunset', 'Forest'.\n- [ ] Step 7: Integration: Routing and Global Styles - Configure React Router in `src/App.tsx`. Wrap the application with the `AppContextProvider`. Define the routes for all pages. Update `src/index.css` to include the accent palette color definitions (e.g., `--accent-primary`) that change based on the `data-accent` attribute on the body.\n"
