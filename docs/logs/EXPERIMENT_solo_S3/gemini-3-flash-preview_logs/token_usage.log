------------------- REQUEST SUMMARY -------------------
Request: **Fully build a multi-page promo app for a photo service “Lumen”.** ### Pages and routing * Implement routes: * `/` Home * `/gallery` Gallery * `/upload` Upload (mock UI only) * `/about` About * `/settings` Settings * Provide a persistent top navigation visible on all pages with links labeled exactly: * **Home**, **Gallery**, **Upload**, **About**, **Settings** * App title “Lumen” appears in the header. ### Theming + accent palettes * Support **light** and **dark** themes. * Support **3 accent palettes** with ids and labels: * `ocean` (label: “Ocean”) * `sunset` (label: “Sunset”) * `forest` (label: “Forest”) * Theme + accent must persist across sessions using **localStorage** with keys: * `lumen.theme` = `light|dark` * `lumen.accent` = `ocean|sunset|forest` * Expose controls in Settings: * Theme toggle (accessible name “Theme”) * Accent selector (accessible name “Accent color”) ### Localization (English + German) * Provide a language switcher visible on all pages (header or settings) with accessible name **“Language”**. * Supported languages: `en` and `de`. * Persist language across sessions in localStorage: * `lumen.lang` = `en|de` * Store translations in: * `src/i18n/en.ts` * `src/i18n/de.ts` * All user-visible UI strings must come from the translation files (no hardcoded English/German in components). * Dates must localize based on the selected language using `Intl.DateTimeFormat`. * Use at least one deterministic date displayed in the Gallery item detail/label: **2025-06-01**. ### Gallery page * Load images from `src/data/gallery.ts` with exactly **12 items**. * Each item has: * `id` (string) * `title` (translation key or localized string) * `date` (ISO string; at least one item uses `2025-06-01`) * `tags` (array) where tags come from this fixed set: * `portrait`, `nature`, `urban` * `placeholder` (inline base64 or SVG string; no remote URLs) * Render a responsive “masonry-like” grid (implementation up to you), but must include: * a container with `data-testid="gallery-grid"` * each tile has `data-testid="gallery-item"` * each tile shows title, localized date label (e.g., “Taken on …”), and tags * Filtering: * Provide a filter control with accessible name “Filter” that can select: * All, Portrait, Nature, Urban * Filtering is client-only and updates the visible items. ### Offline-ready simulation (no real service worker) * Implement `src/utils/offlineCache.ts` that simulates caching: * Provide `cacheAsset(key, value)` and `getAsset(key)` and an `isOffline()` state. * When offline is enabled, reads should come from the cache if available. * Provide a dev toolbar visible in the app with: * a toggle labeled **“Offline mode”** (`data-testid="offline-toggle"`) * an indicator text that becomes visible when offline: **“Offline mode enabled”** * When offline mode is enabled: * Gallery must still render using cached `gallery.ts` data (simulate cached response). * No network calls are required; just simulate the behavior in-app. * Offline simulation can be enabled/disabled from Settings as well (same state). ### Upload page (mock UI only) * Include a mock upload form (no actual upload) with: * file picker control * disabled “Upload” button * helper text indicating it’s a demo ### Settings page * Must include controls for: * Theme * Accent color * Language * Offline simulation enabled/disabled * Add `data-testid` for: * `theme-toggle`, `accent-select`, `language-select`
