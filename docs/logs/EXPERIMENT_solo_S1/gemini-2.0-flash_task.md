You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured.

Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project.

SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

  "content": "Okay, I understand the requirements. Here's the plan to build the 3-page React app with the specified features:\n\n**1. Plan:**\n\n*   **File Reading:**\n    *   `src/App.tsx`: To set up the routes for the different pages.\n    *   `tailwind.config.ts`: To potentially add custom styling or extend the default theme.\n    *   `src/index.css`: To add global styles.\n\n*   **Component Structure:**\n    *   `src/components/Header.tsx`:  Will contain the logo, navigation links, and mobile hamburger menu. The hamburger menu will use a slide-over dialog.\n    *   `src/components/Footer.tsx`: Will contain the sitemap links and social links.\n    *   `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`: Basic home page content.\n    *   `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx`: Will contain the pricing plan cards and the monthly/yearly toggle.\n    *   `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`: Will contain the contact form with client-side validation.\n    *   `src/components/PricingCard.tsx`: Reusable component for displaying a pricing plan.\n    *   `src/components/Button.tsx`: Reusable button component for consistent styling and accessibility.\n\n*   **Features Implementation:**\n    *   **Header:**\n        *   Logo: A clickable link using `<Link>` from `react-router-dom`.\n        *   Navigation:  `<Link>` components for Home, Pricing, and Contact.\n        *   Hamburger Menu: A button that toggles the visibility of a slide-over menu.  The slide-over will be implemented using a modal-like approach with CSS transitions for the slide-over effect.  A close button will be included in the slide-over.\n    *   **Footer:**\n        *   Sitemap Links: `<Link>` components.\n        *   Social Links:  `<a>` tags with `aria-label` for accessibility.\n    *   **Pricing Page:**\n        *   Pricing Cards:  Reusable `PricingCard` components.\n        *   Toggle: A controlled component (e.g., using a radio button group or a custom toggle) to switch between monthly and yearly pricing.  The toggle will have an accessible name using `aria-label`.\n        *   Recommended Plan:  A badge (e.g., a `<span>` element) with the text \"Recommended\" will be displayed on the Pro plan card.\n    *   **Contact Page:**\n        *   Form:  Will use `react-hook-form` for form management and validation.\n        *   Validation:  Will implement the specified validation rules (required fields, email format, minimum message length).\n        *   Error Messages:  Inline error messages will be displayed next to invalid fields.  `aria-invalid` will be used to indicate invalid fields accessibly.\n        *   Toast:  `react-toastify` will be used to display a success message after successful form submission.\n    *   **Accessibility:**\n        *   All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, toggle) will have appropriate accessible names using `aria-label` or by providing descriptive text content.\n        *   Error messages will be associated with their corresponding form fields using `aria-describedby`.\n        *   The slide-over menu will behave like a dialog, trapping focus and providing a close button.\n\n**2.

Social links must have accessible names. * Pricing page * Contains exactly 3 pricing plan cards with plan names: Basic, Pro, Enterprise. * Each plan card shows a price and a CTA button/link with accessible name (e.g. “Get Started with Basic”). * Include a billing period toggle that switches between Monthly and Yearly pricing. * The toggle must be keyboard operable and have an accessible name containing “Billing”, “Monthly/Yearly”, or “Pricing period”. * Use these prices: * Basic: $10/month, $96/year * Pro: $20/month, $192/year * Enterprise: $40/month, $384/year * Mark Pro as the recommended plan with a visible badge containing the word “Recommended”. * Contact page * Client-side validated form with inputs: Name, Email, Message and a Submit button. * Validation rules: * Name required * Email required + valid email format * Message required (min 10 characters) * Show inline error messages next to each invalid field. * Invalid fields must be indicated accessibly * On successful submit, show a toast/notification with the text “Message sent successfully”\"\n\n        1. **Plan** — first, list the *minimal* set of files you will read to implement this change, and why each is needed.

  "content": "Okay, I understand the requirements. Here's the plan to build the 3-page React app with the specified features:\n\n**1. Plan:**\n\n*   **File Reading:**\n    *   `src/App.tsx`: To set up the routes for the different pages.\n    *   `tailwind.config.ts`: To potentially add custom styling or extend the default theme.\n    *   `src/index.css`: To add global styles.\n\n*   **Component Structure:**\n    *   `src/components/Header.tsx`:  Will contain the logo, navigation links, and mobile hamburger menu. The hamburger menu will use a slide-over dialog.\n    *   `src/components/Footer.tsx`: Will contain the sitemap links and social links.\n    *   `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`: Basic home page content.\n    *   `src/pages/PricingPage.tsx`: Will contain the pricing plan cards and the monthly/yearly toggle.\n    *   `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`: Will contain the contact form with client-side validation.\n    *   `src/components/PricingCard.tsx`: Reusable component for displaying a pricing plan.\n    *   `src/components/Button.tsx`: Reusable button component for consistent styling and accessibility.\n\n*   **Features Implementation:**\n    *   **Header:**\n        *   Logo: A clickable link using `<Link>` from `react-router-dom`.\n        *   Navigation:  `<Link>` components for Home, Pricing, and Contact.\n        *   Hamburger Menu: A button that toggles the visibility of a slide-over menu.  The slide-over will be implemented using a modal-like approach with CSS transitions for the slide-over effect.  A close button will be included in the slide-over.\n    *   **Footer:**\n        *   Sitemap Links: `<Link>` components.\n        *   Social Links:  `<a>` tags with `aria-label` for accessibility.\n    *   **Pricing Page:**\n        *   Pricing Cards:  Reusable `PricingCard` components.\n        *   Toggle: A controlled component (e.g., using a radio button group or a custom toggle) to switch between monthly and yearly pricing.  The toggle will have an accessible name using `aria-label`.\n        *   Recommended Plan:  A badge (e.g., a `<span>` element) with the text \"Recommended\" will be displayed on the Pro plan card.\n    *   **Contact Page:**\n        *   Form:  Will use `react-hook-form` for form management and validation.\n        *   Validation:  Will implement the specified validation rules (required fields, email format, minimum message length).\n        *   Error Messages:  Inline error messages will be displayed next to invalid fields.  `aria-invalid` will be used to indicate invalid fields accessibly.\n        *   Toast:  `react-toastify` will be used to display a success message after successful form submission.\n    *   **Accessibility:**\n        *   All interactive elements (links, buttons, form fields, toggle) will have appropriate accessible names using `aria-label` or by providing descriptive text content.\n        *   Error messages will be associated with their corresponding form fields using `aria-describedby`.\n        *   The slide-over menu will behave like a dialog, trapping focus and providing a close button.\n\n**2. Fetch:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"src/App.tsx\", \"tailwind.config.ts\", \"src/index.css\"]\n  }\n}\n```"

{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."
