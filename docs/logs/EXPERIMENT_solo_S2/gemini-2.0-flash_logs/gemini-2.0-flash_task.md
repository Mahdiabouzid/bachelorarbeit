Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5.

Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files.

Plan:**\n\n*   **Files to Read:**\n    *   `src/App.tsx`: To add routes for the new pages.\n    *   `src/index.css`: To add global styles, including the black, white, and gold color scheme, modern fonts, and smooth scrolling.\n*   **Components to Create:**\n    *   `src/components/Navbar.tsx`: Sticky navigation bar with links to different sections.\n    *   `src/components/Hero.tsx`: Full-screen hero section with background image, name, and tagline.\n    *   `src/components/About.tsx`: About section with bio, photo, and list of skills.\n    *   `src/components/Portfolio.tsx`: Masonry grid layout for project thumbnails.\n    *   `src/components/ProjectDetails.tsx`: Component to display project details when a thumbnail is clicked.\n    *   `src/components/Services.tsx`: List of services with icons.\n    *   `src/components/Contact.tsx`: Contact form and social media icons.\n    *   `src/pages/Home.tsx`: Main page that combines all the components.\n*   **Implementation Details:**\n    *   **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Define the black, white, and gold color palette in `index.css`.\n    *   **Responsiveness:** Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the website looks good on all devices.\n    *   **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement smooth scrolling using CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in `index.css`.\n    *   **Animations:** Use CSS transitions and animations for subtle fade-in and zoom effects on scroll. I will likely use a library like `react-intersection-observer` to trigger these animations when elements come into view.\n    *   **Masonry Grid:** Implement the masonry grid layout using CSS grid or a library like `react-masonry-css`.\n    *   **Contact Form:** A simple form with name, email, and message fields.\n    *   **Icons:** Use react-icons for social media and service icons.\n    *   **Images:** I will use placeholder images for the portfolio thumbnails and background image.\n    *   **Accessibility:** Ensure all components are accessible by using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and using appropriate ARIA attributes.\n\n**2.

  "content": "Okay, I understand the task. I need to create a personal portfolio website for Alex Rivera, a freelance graphic designer. Here's my plan:\n\n**1. Plan:**\n\n*   **Files to Read:**\n    *   `src/App.tsx`: To add routes for the new pages.\n    *   `src/index.css`: To add global styles, including the black, white, and gold color scheme, modern fonts, and smooth scrolling.\n*   **Components to Create:**\n    *   `src/components/Navbar.tsx`: Sticky navigation bar with links to different sections.\n    *   `src/components/Hero.tsx`: Full-screen hero section with background image, name, and tagline.\n    *   `src/components/About.tsx`: About section with bio, photo, and list of skills.\n    *   `src/components/Portfolio.tsx`: Masonry grid layout for project thumbnails.\n    *   `src/components/ProjectDetails.tsx`: Component to display project details when a thumbnail is clicked.\n    *   `src/components/Services.tsx`: List of services with icons.\n    *   `src/components/Contact.tsx`: Contact form and social media icons.\n    *   `src/pages/Home.tsx`: Main page that combines all the components.\n*   **Implementation Details:**\n    *   **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Define the black, white, and gold color palette in `index.css`.\n    *   **Responsiveness:** Use Tailwind's responsive modifiers (e.g., `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the website looks good on all devices.\n    *   **Smooth Scrolling:** Implement smooth scrolling using CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth;` in `index.css`.\n    *   **Animations:** Use CSS transitions and animations for subtle fade-in and zoom effects on scroll. I will likely use a library like `react-intersection-observer` to trigger these animations when elements come into view.\n    *   **Masonry Grid:** Implement the masonry grid layout using CSS grid or a library like `react-masonry-css`.\n    *   **Contact Form:** A simple form with name, email, and message fields.\n    *   **Icons:** Use react-icons for social media and service icons.\n    *   **Images:** I will use placeholder images for the portfolio thumbnails and background image.\n    *   **Accessibility:** Ensure all components are accessible by using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and using appropriate ARIA attributes.\n\n**2. Fetch:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"src/App.tsx\", \"src/index.css\"]\n  }\n}\n```"

Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5.

Looking at the `Contact.tsx` file, the `size` prop of the `FaGithub`, `FaLinkedin`, and `FaTwitter` components is likely the culprit. These components from `react-icons` expect a number for the `size` prop, but it's possible that the styling is overriding this and passing a string. Since the code provided doesn't show where the `size` prop is being used, I will fetch the `package.json` file to check the version of `react-icons` being used. If the version is recent, the `size` prop should expect a number. I will then modify the `Contact.tsx` file to ensure that a number is passed to the `size` prop.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"package.json\"]\n  }\n}\n```"

Looking at the `Contact.tsx` file, the `size` prop of the `FaGithub`, `FaLinkedin`, and `FaTwitter` components is likely the culprit. These components from `react-icons` expect a number for the `size` prop, but it's possible that the styling is overriding this and passing a string. Since the code provided doesn't show where the `size` prop is being used, I will fetch the `package.json` file to check the version of `react-icons` being used. If the version is recent, the `size` prop should expect a number. I will then modify the `Contact.tsx` file to ensure that a number is passed to the `size` prop.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"package.json\"]\n  }\n}\n```"

  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."
