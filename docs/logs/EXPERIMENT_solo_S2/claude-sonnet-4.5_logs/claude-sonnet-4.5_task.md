  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

responsive portfolio website with hero section, sticky navigation, about section, masonry portfolio grid with modal, services section, and contact form using black, white, and gold color scheme.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Created a comprehensive personal portfolio website for Alex Rivera with the following implementation:\\n\\n**Architecture:**\\n- **Component-based structure**: Separated concerns into reusable components (Navbar, Hero, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact, Footer)\\n- **Single-page application**: All sections on one scrollable page with smooth navigation\\n- **Data-driven approach**: Centralized mock data in `src/utils/data.ts` for easy content management\\n\\n**Key Components:**\\n\\n1. **Navbar Component** (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`):\\n   - Sticky positioning with backdrop blur effect\\n   - Smooth scroll navigation to sections using hash links\\n   - Mobile-responsive hamburger menu\\n   - Active section highlighting based on scroll position\\n   - Gold accent on hover with smooth transitions\\n\\n2. **Hero Component** (`src/components/Hero.tsx`):\\n   - Full-screen section with gradient overlay\\n   - Animated entrance with fade-in and slide-up effects\\n   - Prominent name display with gold accent\\n   - Tagline with staggered animation\\n   - Scroll indicator with bounce animation\\n\\n3. **About Component** (`src/components/About.tsx`):\\n   - Two-column layout (photo + bio) on desktop, stacked on mobile\\n   - Circular profile image with gold border\\n   - Bio text with professional description\\n   - Grid of tools/technologies with icons from react-icons\\n   - Scroll-triggered fade-in animations using Intersection Observer\\n\\n4. **Portfolio Component** (`src/components/Portfolio.tsx`):\\n   - CSS Grid masonry layout with 6 project cards\\n   - Hover effects with scale and overlay\\n   - Modal system for detailed project view\\n   - Project details include title, description, tools used, and large image\\n   - Close modal with X button or clicking outside\\n   - Smooth transitions and animations\\n\\n5. **Services Component** (`src/components/Services.tsx`):\\n   - Three service cards: Branding, UI/UX Design, Illustration\\n   - Icons from lucide-react\\n   - Hover effects with gold accent and lift animation\\n   - Detailed descriptions for each service\\n   - Responsive grid layout\\n\\n6. **Contact Component** (`src/components/Contact.tsx`):\\n   - Fully functional form using react-hook-form\\n   - Validation for name, email, and message fields\\n   - Toast notifications using react-toastify for success/error feedback\\n   - Social media icons (LinkedIn, Dribbble, Behance, Instagram) with external links\\n   - Gold accent on form focus states\\n   - Responsive two-column layout\\n\\n7. **Footer Component** (`src/components/Footer.tsx`):\\n   - Simple copyright notice\\n   - Consistent styling with overall theme\\n\\n**Data Management** (`src/utils/data.ts`):\\n- Centralized data for projects (6 unique graphic design projects)\\n- Services information\\n- Tools and technologies\\n- Social media links\\n- Easy to update and maintain\\n\\n**Styling Approach:**\\n- **Color Palette**: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#D4AF37)\\n- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif fonts from Tailwind\\n- **Animations**: Custom keyframe animations defined in `index.css`\\n- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)\\n- **Smooth Scrolling**: CSS scroll-behavior: smooth\\n- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-triggered animations\\n\\n**Technical Features:**\\n- TypeScript for type safety\\n- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management\\n- React Hook Form for form validation\\n- React Toastify for user feedback\\n- React Icons and Lucide React for iconography\\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\\n- Smooth scroll navigation with hash routing\\n- Accessible markup with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML\\n\\n**User Experience:**\\n- Smooth transitions between sections\\n- Interactive hover states on all clickable elements\\n- Loading states and feedback for form submission\\n- Modal for detailed project views\\n- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu\\n- Visual feedback for all interactions\\n- Optimized for performance with lazy loading considerations\\n\\nThe portfolio is production-ready, fully functional, and showcases Alex Rivera's work in a visually stunning, professional manner.\",\n    \"changes\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"modify\",\n

```json
{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props. In `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`, existing `<button>` elements were replaced with the new `<Button>` component to standardize styling and behavior across the page.\",\n    \"changes\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"create\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/Button.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"import React from 'react';\\n\\nexport interface ButtonProps {\\n  label: string;\\n  onClick: () => void;\\n}\\n\\nexport const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ label, onClick }) => {\\n  return (\\n    <button className=\\\"px-4 py-2 rounded bg-blue-500 text-white\\\" onClick={onClick}>\\n      {label}\\n    </button>\\n  );\\n};\\n\",\n        \"differences\": null\n      },\n      {\n        \"type\": \"modify\",\n        \"path\": \"src/pages/Dashboard.tsx\",\n        \"content\": null,\n        \"differences\": [\n          \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<button onClick={handleRefresh}>Refresh</button>\\n=======\\n<Button label=\\\"Refresh\\\" onClick={handleRefresh} />\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\",\n          \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<button onClick={loadMore}>Load More</button>\\n=======\\n<Button label=\\\"Load More\\\" onClick={loadMore} />\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\",\n          \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<button disabled={!canSubmit} onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit</button>\\n=======\\n<Button label=\\\"Submit\\\" onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={!canSubmit} />\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n# WORKFLOW:\n1. Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

responsive portfolio website with hero section, sticky navigation, about section, masonry portfolio grid with modal, services section, and contact form using black, white, and gold color scheme.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Created a comprehensive personal portfolio website for Alex Rivera with the following implementation:\\n\\n**Architecture:**\\n- **Component-based structure**: Separated concerns into reusable components (Navbar, Hero, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact, Footer)\\n- **Single-page application**: All sections on one scrollable page with smooth navigation\\n- **Data-driven approach**: Centralized mock data in `src/utils/data.ts` for easy content management\\n\\n**Key Components:**\\n\\n1. **Navbar Component** (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`):\\n   - Sticky positioning with backdrop blur effect\\n   - Smooth scroll navigation to sections using hash links\\n   - Mobile-responsive hamburger menu\\n   - Active section highlighting based on scroll position\\n   - Gold accent on hover with smooth transitions\\n\\n2. **Hero Component** (`src/components/Hero.tsx`):\\n   - Full-screen section with gradient overlay\\n   - Animated entrance with fade-in and slide-up effects\\n   - Prominent name display with gold accent\\n   - Tagline with staggered animation\\n   - Scroll indicator with bounce animation\\n\\n3. **About Component** (`src/components/About.tsx`):\\n   - Two-column layout (photo + bio) on desktop, stacked on mobile\\n   - Circular profile image with gold border\\n   - Bio text with professional description\\n   - Grid of tools/technologies with icons from react-icons\\n   - Scroll-triggered fade-in animations using Intersection Observer\\n\\n4. **Portfolio Component** (`src/components/Portfolio.tsx`):\\n   - CSS Grid masonry layout with 6 project cards\\n   - Hover effects with scale and overlay\\n   - Modal system for detailed project view\\n   - Project details include title, description, tools used, and large image\\n   - Close modal with X button or clicking outside\\n   - Smooth transitions and animations\\n\\n5. **Services Component** (`src/components/Services.tsx`):\\n   - Three service cards: Branding, UI/UX Design, Illustration\\n   - Icons from lucide-react\\n   - Hover effects with gold accent and lift animation\\n   - Detailed descriptions for each service\\n   - Responsive grid layout\\n\\n6. **Contact Component** (`src/components/Contact.tsx`):\\n   - Fully functional form using react-hook-form\\n   - Validation for name, email, and message fields\\n   - Toast notifications using react-toastify for success/error feedback\\n   - Social media icons (LinkedIn, Dribbble, Behance, Instagram) with external links\\n   - Gold accent on form focus states\\n   - Responsive two-column layout\\n\\n7. **Footer Component** (`src/components/Footer.tsx`):\\n   - Simple copyright notice\\n   - Consistent styling with overall theme\\n\\n**Data Management** (`src/utils/data.ts`):\\n- Centralized data for projects (6 unique graphic design projects)\\n- Services information\\n- Tools and technologies\\n- Social media links\\n- Easy to update and maintain\\n\\n**Styling Approach:**\\n- **Color Palette**: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#D4AF37)\\n- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif fonts from Tailwind\\n- **Animations**: Custom keyframe animations defined in `index.css`\\n- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)\\n- **Smooth Scrolling**: CSS scroll-behavior: smooth\\n- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-triggered animations\\n\\n**Technical Features:**\\n- TypeScript for type safety\\n- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management\\n- React Hook Form for form validation\\n- React Toastify for user feedback\\n- React Icons and Lucide React for iconography\\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\\n- Smooth scroll navigation with hash routing\\n- Accessible markup with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML\\n\\n**User Experience:**\\n- Smooth transitions between sections\\n- Interactive hover states on all clickable elements\\n- Loading states and feedback for form submission\\n- Modal for detailed project views\\n- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu\\n- Visual feedback for all interactions\\n- Optimized for performance with lazy loading considerations\\n\\nThe portfolio is production-ready, fully functional, and showcases Alex Rivera's work in a visually stunning, professional manner.\",\n    \"changes\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"modify\",\n

{
  "role": "system",
  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."

responsive portfolio website with hero section, sticky navigation, about section, masonry portfolio grid with modal, services section, and contact form using black, white, and gold color scheme.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Created a comprehensive personal portfolio website for Alex Rivera with the following implementation:\\n\\n**Architecture:**\\n- **Component-based structure**: Separated concerns into reusable components (Navbar, Hero, About, Portfolio, Services, Contact, Footer)\\n- **Single-page application**: All sections on one scrollable page with smooth navigation\\n- **Data-driven approach**: Centralized mock data in `src/utils/data.ts` for easy content management\\n\\n**Key Components:**\\n\\n1. **Navbar Component** (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`):\\n   - Sticky positioning with backdrop blur effect\\n   - Smooth scroll navigation to sections using hash links\\n   - Mobile-responsive hamburger menu\\n   - Active section highlighting based on scroll position\\n   - Gold accent on hover with smooth transitions\\n\\n2. **Hero Component** (`src/components/Hero.tsx`):\\n   - Full-screen section with gradient overlay\\n   - Animated entrance with fade-in and slide-up effects\\n   - Prominent name display with gold accent\\n   - Tagline with staggered animation\\n   - Scroll indicator with bounce animation\\n\\n3. **About Component** (`src/components/About.tsx`):\\n   - Two-column layout (photo + bio) on desktop, stacked on mobile\\n   - Circular profile image with gold border\\n   - Bio text with professional description\\n   - Grid of tools/technologies with icons from react-icons\\n   - Scroll-triggered fade-in animations using Intersection Observer\\n\\n4. **Portfolio Component** (`src/components/Portfolio.tsx`):\\n   - CSS Grid masonry layout with 6 project cards\\n   - Hover effects with scale and overlay\\n   - Modal system for detailed project view\\n   - Project details include title, description, tools used, and large image\\n   - Close modal with X button or clicking outside\\n   - Smooth transitions and animations\\n\\n5. **Services Component** (`src/components/Services.tsx`):\\n   - Three service cards: Branding, UI/UX Design, Illustration\\n   - Icons from lucide-react\\n   - Hover effects with gold accent and lift animation\\n   - Detailed descriptions for each service\\n   - Responsive grid layout\\n\\n6. **Contact Component** (`src/components/Contact.tsx`):\\n   - Fully functional form using react-hook-form\\n   - Validation for name, email, and message fields\\n   - Toast notifications using react-toastify for success/error feedback\\n   - Social media icons (LinkedIn, Dribbble, Behance, Instagram) with external links\\n   - Gold accent on form focus states\\n   - Responsive two-column layout\\n\\n7. **Footer Component** (`src/components/Footer.tsx`):\\n   - Simple copyright notice\\n   - Consistent styling with overall theme\\n\\n**Data Management** (`src/utils/data.ts`):\\n- Centralized data for projects (6 unique graphic design projects)\\n- Services information\\n- Tools and technologies\\n- Social media links\\n- Easy to update and maintain\\n\\n**Styling Approach:**\\n- **Color Palette**: Black (#000000), White (#FFFFFF), Gold (#D4AF37)\\n- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif fonts from Tailwind\\n- **Animations**: Custom keyframe animations defined in `index.css`\\n- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl)\\n- **Smooth Scrolling**: CSS scroll-behavior: smooth\\n- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-triggered animations\\n\\n**Technical Features:**\\n- TypeScript for type safety\\n- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management\\n- React Hook Form for form validation\\n- React Toastify for user feedback\\n- React Icons and Lucide React for iconography\\n- Tailwind CSS for styling\\n- Smooth scroll navigation with hash routing\\n- Accessible markup with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML\\n\\n**User Experience:**\\n- Smooth transitions between sections\\n- Interactive hover states on all clickable elements\\n- Loading states and feedback for form submission\\n- Modal for detailed project views\\n- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu\\n- Visual feedback for all interactions\\n- Optimized for performance with lazy loading considerations\\n\\nThe portfolio is production-ready, fully functional, and showcases Alex Rivera's work in a visually stunning, professional manner.\",\n    \"changes\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"modify\",\n

  "content": "You are an Agent, an expert senior frontend engineer specializing in building modern, and responsive user interfaces using React and TypeScript. You will be working within an automated system that automatically extracts, parses, and saves any code you provide in your responses. Each file is checked using `tsc --noEmit` to ensure that your code is syntactically correct. You use your tools to interact with this system and accomplish the user's requests.\n\n# Goal:\nYou will be working on a React project with all dependencies installed and pre-configured. With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write only the code necessary to fulfill the user’s request. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application. If any errors occur, you will be notified accordingly.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response.\n\nYou have access to the following tools:\n\n## fetch_files:\nUsing this tool will give you the full contents of the files requested. If you need to examine multiple  files at once, put all of the file paths in the `filePaths` parameter.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/File1.tsx\", \"path/to/File2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## ask_followup_question:\nAsk **follow-up questions** if user provided ambiguous instructions or no instructions at all.\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"ask_followup_question\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"question\": \"question to user\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files:\nOnce you have all the information you need, use the `write_to_files` tool to write your changes to the project. Only one `write_to_files` can be used. Always include all your file creations/modifications/deletes in one response.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"Brief, one-to-two sentence description of the change\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Detailed explanation of how the changes were implemented and the reasoning behind your architectural choices, including A clear explanation of how of how each component was implemented, what features it presents and how it can be used\",\n    \"changes\": [\n        {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/relative/file/path.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content here as a single string...\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 1>\\n=======\\n<new code block 1>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\", \"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block 2>\\n=======\\n<new code block 2>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"],\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n    *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. The system will automatically create the file and any required directories.\n    *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n    *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE Rules (for \"modify\" only)\n\nEach item in the `differences` array must be a string containing one `SEARCH/REPLACE` block.\n\n```\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n5. Both `SEARCH` and `REPLACE` blocks for the same change **MUST** be grouped together in a single object of the `differences` array\n\n# EXAMPLE:\n## write_to_files usage example:\n```json\n{\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Add Button component and update Dashboard\",\n    \"summary\": \"Created a new reusable `Button` component and modified `Dashboard.tsx` to use it.\",\n    \"implementation\": \"A new `Button` component was added under `src/components/Button.tsx`, accepting `label` and `onClick` props.

Thoroughly Understand the Problem:\n   Carefully read the user’s request and analyze it critically to fully understand what’s needed before taking any action. Pay special attention to project specefic details such as dependency structure.\n2. Break Down the Request into Manageable Parts:\n   Decompose the task into smaller, logical components—starting from simple building blocks and progressing to more complex structures.\n   For example, if the user asks for a new page:\n   1. Begin by creating the individual components needed for the page, such as `Header.tsx`, `Footer.tsx`, `CTASection.tsx`, etc. under `src/components`\n   2. Assemble these components into a single page component (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`) under `src/pages`.\n   3. Add the appropriate route for the new page in `App.tsx`.\n   4. If multiple pages are requested, repeat steps 1–2 for each page, then proceed to step 3.\n3. Determine File Changes Based on the User’s Request:\n   Use the dependency structure in the user's request to identify which files need to be created or modified.\n4. fecth the files needed using the fetch_files tool\n5. Write all file modifcations using the tool `write_to_files`\n\n# FINAL INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Only **one** tool call can be used per response.\n- **Scope Limitation:** You are working inside a pre-configured project. Your ONLY responsibility is to modify files within the `src/` directory. You do not have permission to access or alter root-level files. This includes, but is not limited to: `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.ts`, `postcss.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`, `index.html`, or any files outside of the `src/` folder.\n- Be selective with fetch_files. Only fetch the files you are confident you need to modify or read to complete the current request.\n- Use the **exact** contents of files provided back by the `fetch_files` tool. Do NOT guess or make up an answer.\n- The full request must be completed with one single `write_to_file` tool call no matter how big it is.\n- Think step by step, understand your workflow, generate a plan accordingly, then fetch the files you need. Once you get the contents of these files continue to execute your plan."
