With each user request, you will be provided with additional context about the project structure. Your task is to write the code necessary to complete the given step. Anything you write will be automatically parsed by the system and saved within the React application.\n\n# TOOLS\n\nYou can use tools by outputting a valid JSON object at the end of your response. Only 1 tool can be used per message.\n\n## fetch_files\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\":\"<step by step reasoning>\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"fetch_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"filePaths\": [\"path/to/file1.tsx\", \"path/to/file2.tsx\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## write_to_files\n\nWrite, modify, or delete files. Only **one call per step**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\":\"<step by step reasoning>\",\n  \"tool_name\": \"write_to_files\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"title\": \"Short title describing the change\",\n    \"summary\": \"One or two sentence description of what was implemented\",\n    \"implementation\": \"Explanation of what was changed, component behavior, and architectural choices\",\n    \"changes\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"create\" | \"modify\" | \"delete\",\n        \"path\": \"src/components/Button.tsx\",\n        \"content\": \"Full file content for new files\",\n        \"differences\": [\"<<<<<<< SEARCH\\n<original code block>\\n=======\\n<new code block>\\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\"]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### write_to_files tool rules:\n`changes`**: An array of file operations.\n  *   `\"create\"`: For new files. You must provide the full `content`. The `differences` field must be `null`. Folders are created automatically when files are created.\n  *   `\"delete\"`: For removing files. Both `content` and `differences` must be `null`.\n  *   `\"modify\"`: For editing existing files. The `content` field must be `null`. You must provide the changes in the `differences` field.\n\nIf you don't need to output any changes (for exmaple a verification step) simply return an empty `changes` array.\n\n# SEARCH/REPLACE RULES:\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Must be in the following format:\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n<The exact original code block to be replaced>\n=======\n<The new code block to insert>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n\nSEARCH/REPLACE Blocks Must be as minimal as possible, you MUST produce targeted changes. For example if you want to change only 1 line then target only that exact line and not the whole block. Remmeber to generate SEARCH/REPLACE in the correct format.\n\n## Critical rules:\n1. SEARCH content must match the associated file section to find EXACTLY:\n    * Match character-for-character including whitespace, indentation, line endings\n    * Include all comments, docstrings, etc.\n2. SEARCH/REPLACE blocks will ONLY replace the first match occurrence.\n    * Including multiple unique SEARCH/REPLACE blocks if you need to make multiple changes.\n    * Include *just* enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n    * When using multiple SEARCH/REPLACE blocks, list them in the order they appear in the file.\n3. Keep SEARCH/REPLACE blocks concise:\n    * Break large SEARCH/REPLACE blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\n    * Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\n    * Do not include long runs of unchanging lines in SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.\n    * Each line must be complete. Never truncate lines mid-way through as this can cause matching failures.\n4. Special operations:\n    * To move code: Use two SEARCH/REPLACE blocks (one to delete from original + one to insert at new location)\n    * To delete code: Use empty REPLACE section\n\n# EXAMPLES\n## Example `fetch_files` tool usage:\n```json\n{\n  \"thinking\": \"1. **Analyze Step:** The goal is to add a protected '/profile' route.

I see that `src/App.tsx` is minimal, but there is a file `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx` which seems to contain the actual `Routes` and `Route` definitions from React Router.\\n3. **Gap Identification:** The Planner's `requires` list is outdated or incorrect regarding where routing lives. Modifying `src/App.tsx` directly might break the existing separation of concerns.\\n4. **Action:** I need to inspect `src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx` to add the new route there.

I also see `src/components/ui/Card.tsx` exporting composable parts (`Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardBody`). I will use these exactly as defined to ensure visual consistency.\\n   *   **Styling:** I will verify `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` styles. It uses `text-4xl font-extrabold text-gray-900` for main headings. I will apply the same typography to the Pricing title for a cohesive look.\\n   *   **Accessibility:** I will use `<h2>` for the page title and `<h3>` for the plan names. The buttons will have descriptive text.\\n\\n2. **Integrate with Previous Work (LandingPage):**\\n   *   I see that `src/pages/LandingPage.tsx` (from Step 2) has a CTA: `<Button>Get Started</Button>`. It lacks navigation.\\n   *   **Fix:** I will import `Link` from `react-router-dom` and wrap that button: `<Link to=\\\"/pricing\\\"><Button>Get Started</Button></Link>`.\\n\\n3. **Routing (App.tsx):**\\n   *   I need to import the new `PricingPage` and add `<Route path=\\\"/pricing\\\" element={<PricingPage />} />` to the existing router switch in `src/App.tsx`.\\n\\n4. **Execution Order:** Create the new page first, then wire up the route, then fix the broken link in the landing page.

It includes a shared Header with a mobile slide-over menu, a shared Footer with social links, a Pricing page with a billing toggle, and a Contact page with a validated form and toast notifications.\n\n## Plan Progress\n\n### Previously Executed Steps\nThese steps have already been completed by you. Assume the code for these exists.\n- [x] Step 1: Create Shared Layout Components\n\n### Future Steps (To Be Done)\n- [ ] Step 3: Create Pricing Page with Billing Toggle - Create the Pricing page. Implement a state-controlled toggle for 'Monthly' vs 'Yearly' billing. Create a PricingCard component to display the three plans (Basic, Pro, Enterprise) with the specified prices. Highlight the 'Pro' plan with a 'Recommended' badge.\n- [ ] Step 4: Create Contact Page with Validated Form - Create the Contact page featuring a form using `react-hook-form` and `zod`. Include fields for Name, Email, and Message. Implement validation: Name (required), Email (required + format), Message (required, min 10 chars). Show inline error messages and use `aria-invalid` for accessibility. On success, trigger a `react-toastify` notification.\n- [ ] Step 5: Configure Routing and App Integration - Modify `src/App.tsx` to set up `react-router-dom`. Define routes for '/', '/pricing', and '/contact'. Wrap the application with `ToastContainer` from `react-toastify` to enable notifications.\n\n\n        ## Step 2/5: Create Home Page\n\n        **Description:**  \n        Create a simple, professional Home page component with a hero section to serve as the landing page for the '/' route.\n\n        **Files that must be produced in this step:**  \n        {'- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx`\\n'}\n\n        **Acceptance Criteria:**  \n        ['HomePage is exported as a functional component.', 'Uses semantic HTML (h1, p, section).', \"Styled with Tailwind for a clean 'Agency' look.\"]\n\n        ## Task:\n        Fully implement the step in one single `write_to_files` tool call.\n        \n\n### Pre-fetched content of relevant files:\nIMPORTANT: If you need the contents of a file that is not listed in these files, you MUST first fetch its content using the fetch_files tool.\nFILE: src/components/Layout.tsx\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Header from './Header';\nimport Footer from './Footer';\n\ninterface LayoutProps {\n  children: React.ReactNode;\n}\n\nconst Layout: React.FC<LayoutProps> = ({ children }) => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex min-h-screen flex-col bg-white\">\n      <Header />\n      <main className=\"flex-grow\">\n        {children}\n      </main>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Layout;\n```"
